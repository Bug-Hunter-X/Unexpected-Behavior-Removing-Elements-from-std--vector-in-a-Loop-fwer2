This repository demonstrates a common error when removing elements from a `std::vector` in C++ using a loop. The code attempts to remove all elements, but it leaves some elements remaining.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  This issue highlights the importance of understanding how `erase` modifies the vector's size and iterators.
